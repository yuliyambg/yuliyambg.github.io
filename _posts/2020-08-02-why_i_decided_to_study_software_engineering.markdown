I am new to tech ... I am coming from the business field, however I always dreamt about a  career where innovation is bigger part of the work. Here are some of the main reasons why I decided to pivot to coding:

•	Creativity and problem solving <br/>

Programming is involving creativity and problem solving. I enjoy intellectual work, therefore I think this is the right path for me. Facing challenging problems and finding an elegant solution for them is bringing me satisfaction and feels rewarding.

•	Master knowledge in different fields

Another reason for choosing the Software Engineering is the privilege to be exposed to different industries, different professional fields and a variety of areas of activity. The curiosity to learn about how different industries work drives my motivation, I am looking forward to trying to understand their principles and potentially master various industries in parallel with my main job as Software Engineer. 

•	Demand

Software Engineering is a profession at high demand, and the demand continues to grow.
In the modern world, surrounded by information technologies every step of the way, the need of the Software engineers is rising as the technologies are constantly evolving. I see myself as a little part of this big machinery and I am thinking wouldn’t be great if I can contribute somehow to the smooth process and functioning of this big machinery. A large part of our reality has shifted to the Internet, where we can do literally everything: meet, communicate, make purchases in online stores, learn, social networking, websites, smart home - the list is endless.

In order to ensure smooth operation of all these products and forms of human life and activity, there is one profession that will be always needed and will never get outdated – Software Engineering. 


•	Opportunity for professional development and career growth

Coding is an area that requires constant learning and improving skills.
I am thrilled by the opportunity to learn new technologies and develop my skills.
Especially the motivation that one day through coding we can contribute to make people’s life easier it’s an engine that fuels my motivation.


 I understand the road to become a Software engineer may be bumpy and will requires a lot of dedication and resilience. I am prepared and armed myself with patience and perseverance to spend my time for running tests, searching for errors in code, debugging them and fixing them!
